kay, let's trace the typical flows within your Spring Boot auth-service application, based on the components we've discussed (Controllers, Services, Repositories, Spring Security with JWT). This assumes the setup as of Friday, April 18, 2025 at 12:25 PM CEST in Älta, Sweden.

Flow 1: Application Startup

    You run the main method in your AuthServiceApplication.java.
    Spring Boot starts up, performing auto-configuration based on your dependencies (spring-boot-starter-web, -data-jpa, -security, etc.).
    Component Scan: Spring scans packages (starting from where AuthServiceApplication is located) for classes annotated with @Component, @Service, @Repository, @RestController, @Configuration, etc.
    Bean Creation & DI: The Spring IoC container creates instances (beans) of these discovered components (e.g., AuthController, AuthService, UserRepository implementation, UserDetailsServiceImpl, JwtUtils, PasswordEncoder, AuthTokenFilter, AuthEntryPointJwt). As it creates these beans, it performs Dependency Injection – providing required dependencies via constructors (preferred) or @Autowired. For example, UserRepository and PasswordEncoder are injected into AuthService.
    Security Configuration: Your SecurityConfig class (@Configuration) is processed. The SecurityFilterChain bean is created. This configures:
        Which endpoints are public (/api/auth/**) and which require authentication (anyRequest().authenticated()).
        Session management to be STATELESS.
        CSRF to be disabled (common for stateless APIs).
        The custom AuthTokenFilter to be added to the filter chain (addFilterBefore).
        The AuthEntryPointJwt to handle unauthorized access attempts.
        The DaoAuthenticationProvider (configured implicitly or explicitly) which uses your UserDetailsServiceImpl and PasswordEncoder for username/password checks.
    Database Connection: The DataSource (e.g., HikariCP connection pool) is configured using your application.properties and connects to your PostgreSQL database.
    JPA/Hibernate Setup: Hibernate initializes, potentially validates or updates the database schema based on your entities (User) and the spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto property.
    Web Server Start: The embedded web server (Tomcat by default) starts and begins listening for incoming HTTP requests on the configured port (e.g., 8081).
    The application is now ready.

Flow 2: User Registration (POST /api/auth/register)

    A client (e.g., Postman, your future React app) sends an HTTP POST request to /api/auth/register with a JSON body containing username and password.
    The request arrives at the embedded Tomcat server.
    It goes through the standard Servlet filters, eventually reaching Spring's DispatcherServlet.
    The DispatcherServlet routes the request to the appropriate handler method - AuthController.registerUser().
    Spring Security Filter Chain: The request passes through the security filters. Because /api/auth/** is configured with .permitAll(), security checks like authentication aren't enforced here, allowing the request to proceed. Your AuthTokenFilter might still run but won't block based on a missing/invalid token for this path.
    Controller (AuthController):
        Jackson library (part of spring-boot-starter-web) deserializes the JSON request body into a RegisterRequest DTO object.
        @Valid annotation triggers bean validation based on annotations in RegisterRequest (e.g., @NotBlank, @Size). If validation fails, Spring typically returns a 400 Bad Request response immediately.
        The registerUser method in the controller is called.
    Service (AuthService):
        The controller calls authService.registerUser(registerRequest).
        The service checks if the username exists using userRepository.existsByUsername(...).
        If it exists, it throws an exception (e.g., RuntimeException or a custom one).
        If it doesn't exist, it encodes the password using the injected PasswordEncoder.
        It creates a new User entity, sets the username, hashed password, and default roles (e.g., Role.ROLE_USER).
        It calls userRepository.save(user).
    Repository/JPA/Hibernate:
        Spring Data JPA generates the implementation for save().
        Hibernate translates this into SQL INSERT statements for the app_users table and the user_roles join table.
        The SQL is executed against the PostgreSQL database within a transaction (if @Transactional is used).
    Back to Service: The saved User object (with generated ID) is returned to the service (or the method completes).
    Back to Controller: The service returns control to the controller. The controller catches any exceptions (like the username exists exception) or handles the success case.
    Response: The controller creates a ResponseEntity (e.g., 201 Created on success with a message, or 400 Bad Request on error) which gets serialized back to JSON (if applicable) and sent back through the servlet container to the client.

Flow 3: User Login (POST /api/auth/login)

    Client sends POST to /api/auth/login with username and password JSON.
    Request hits Tomcat -> DispatcherServlet -> AuthController.authenticateUser().
    Security filter chain allows request due to permitAll().
    Controller deserializes JSON to LoginRequest DTO, validation runs.
    Controller calls authService.authenticateAndGenerateToken(loginRequest).
    Service (AuthService):
        Calls authenticationManager.authenticate(...), passing a UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken containing the raw credentials from the request.
    Authentication Manager (AuthenticationManager -> DaoAuthenticationProvider):
        Calls UserDetailsServiceImpl.loadUserByUsername(...) using the provided username.
        UserDetailsService: Calls userRepository.findByUsername(...) to fetch the User entity from the database. If not found, throws UsernameNotFoundException.
        UserDetailsService: Creates a org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.User object containing the username, hashed password from the DB, and authorities (roles).
        DaoAuthenticationProvider: Compares the password from the UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken (raw password from request) with the hashed password from the loaded UserDetails using the configured PasswordEncoder (passwordEncoder.matches(...)).
        If passwords don't match, throws BadCredentialsException.
        If passwords match and user details are valid (enabled, not locked etc.), it returns a fully authenticated Authentication object containing the UserDetails and granted authorities.
    Back to Service (AuthService):
        If authenticate threw an exception, the service likely lets it propagate (or catches & re-throws).
        If authenticate succeeded, it gets the Authentication object.
        It sets this Authentication object in the SecurityContextHolder.
        It calls jwtUtils.generateJwtToken(authentication) to create the JWT string, including username and roles as claims, signed with the secret key.
        It returns the JWT string.
    Back to Controller (AuthController):
        If an AuthenticationException occurred, the catch block handles it, returning 401 Unauthorized.
        If login succeeded, it receives the JWT string from the service.
        It potentially retrieves user details from the SecurityContextHolder to build a richer response.
        It creates a JwtResponse DTO containing the token ("Bearer" type) and other info.
        It returns a ResponseEntity (200 OK) with the JwtResponse body.
    Response sent back to the client. The client now stores this JWT for subsequent requests.

Flow 4: Authenticated Request (e.g., GET /api/some-protected-resource)

    Client sends request (e.g., GET) to a protected URL, including the JWT in the header: Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>.
    Request hits Tomcat -> DispatcherServlet.
    Spring Security Filter Chain:
        Request eventually hits your AuthTokenFilter (because it was added with addFilterBefore).
        AuthTokenFilter.doFilterInternal executes:
            parseJwt extracts the <jwt_token> string from the header.
            jwtUtils.validateJwtToken validates the token's signature and expiration using the secret key.
            If valid:
                jwtUtils.getUserNameFromJwtToken gets the username from the token's subject claim.
                userDetailsService.loadUserByUsername fetches the corresponding UserDetails (with current roles/status) from the database.
                A new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken is created using the loaded UserDetails (principal), null (credentials), and the authorities.
                SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(...) stores this Authentication object, marking the user as authenticated for this request.
        Request continues down the filter chain.
    Authorization: Spring Security's authorization mechanisms (e.g., configured rules in SecurityConfig like anyRequest().authenticated() or method-level security like @PreAuthorize) check the Authentication object in the SecurityContextHolder.
        Does the user have the required role/authority for /api/some-protected-resource?
        If Yes: The filter chain allows the request to proceed to the DispatcherServlet and then to the target controller method.
        If No: An AccessDeniedException is thrown. This is typically caught by Spring's ExceptionTranslationFilter, which then delegates to an AccessDeniedHandler (or uses the AuthenticationEntryPoint if authentication was missing entirely), usually resulting in a 403 Forbidden response.
    Controller: If authorized, the controller method for /api/some-protected-resource executes. It can access the authenticated user's details via @AuthenticationPrincipal or SecurityContextHolder if needed.
    Response: The controller returns a ResponseEntity, which is sent back to the client.

These flows cover the main interactions within your authentication service using Spring Security and JWT.
